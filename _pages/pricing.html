    <h2>Revenue Share</h2>

    <p>Nooma, <a href="www.stripe.com">Stripe</a>, and the Teacher split earnings from weekly subscriptions.</p>

    <p>Nooma takes 10%, Stripe takes 2.9% + 30Â¢, and you keep the rest.</p>

    <h2 id="electrons-path">Direct Access to Funds</h2>

    <p>You connect your Stripe account directly with Nooma which means 1) total transparency, 2) you get paid immediately after the student pays the subscription, and 3) full access to the email addresses of all paying subscribers.</p>

    <h2 id="electron-api-demos">Set Your Own Price</h2>

    <p>This is your business, you should have the freedom to set the price. We believe running site-wide discounts and promotions are counterproductive and produces a toxic environment. With Nooma, you have full control over the pricing of the services you provide for the students.</p>
